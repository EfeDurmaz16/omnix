# Multi-Model AI Chat Platform - Comprehensive Development Prompt

## Project Overview
Build a comprehensive multi-model AI chat platform that supports various AI models (GPT-4o, Claude, Gemini, HuggingFace models, etc.) with persistent user-specific memory using RAG architecture. The platform must work seamlessly across web and mobile (PWA) with high-performance backend capable of handling concurrent requests.

## Critical Initial Steps
*BEFORE STARTING ANY DEVELOPMENT:*
1. Analyze the entire existing project structure
2. Document current codebase architecture
3. Identify reusable components
4. Plan migration strategy for existing features
5. Create a detailed technical roadmap

## Core Architecture Requirements

### Backend Architecture

User Request → Load Balancer → API Gateway → Service Layer → Model Router → AI Models
                                     ↓
                              RAG System ← Vector DB (User-specific namespaces)
                                     ↓
                              Cache Layer (Redis/Similar)


*Performance Considerations:*
- Backend must handle high concurrent request volumes synchronously
- Use high-performance languages for critical services:
  - *Rust* for memory-intensive operations (embeddings, vector operations)

    def store_interaction(self, user_id, model_name, conversation):
        # Store with user-specific namespace
        embeddings = self.embedding_model.encode(conversation)
        self.vector_db.upsert(
            namespace=f"user_{user_id}",
            vectors=embeddings,
            metadata={"model": model_name, "timestamp": now()}
        )
    
    def retrieve_context(self, user_id, query, k=5):
        # Retrieve relevant past interactions
        query_embedding = self.embedding_model.encode(query)
        self.vector_db.search(
            namespace=f"user_{user_id}",

      case 'resources/list':
        return this.listUserResources(request.userId);
      case 'resources/read':
        return this.readResource(request.resourceId);
      case 'tools/list':
        return this.availableTools();
      case 'tools/execute':
        return this.executeTool(request.tool, request.params);
    }
  }
}


*2. MCP Benefits for Your Platform:*

├── Agent States
└── Custom Databases

MCP Tools → Platform Capabilities
├── Web Search
├── Code Execution
├── Image Generation
├── Data Analysis
└── Custom User Tools


*4. Implementation Approach:*
javascript
// Client-side MCP connection
const mcpClient = new MCPClient({
  servers: {
    'platform-data': {
      command: 'npx',
      args: ['@your-platform/mcp-server']
    },
    'github': {
      command: 'npx',
      args: ['@modelcontextprotocol/server-github']
    }
  }
});

// Use in any model
const context = await mcpClient.readResource('chat-history');
const response = await model.generate(prompt, { context });


*5. MCP + Agent Integration:*
